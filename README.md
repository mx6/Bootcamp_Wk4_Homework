# Bootcamp_Wk4_Homework

This assignment was the most challenging of the assignments so far.  

The requirement was to create a quiz with a start button.  When the button was clicked a countdown timer would start and the user would see the first question.  When the question, the user would be presented with another question.  When questions are answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.  When all questions are answered, or when the timer expires, the game ends, and the user can save their initials and their score.

As I said, this exercise was very challenging for me, but I met all of the requirments, and learned quite a bit in the process.  I had to break down the problem into smaller bits, and seek out answers for those smaller parts, and hope that the solution didn't break the over-all code.

The journey continues!
